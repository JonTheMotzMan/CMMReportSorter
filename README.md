# CMMReportSorter
Going to create a report sorting software for internal maunfactured goods for quality.

This project is mainly for internal use only but will be open to the public as a reference tool.

This program will detect when new reports have been generated and places the report PDF into the part folder associated with it.

This is a follow up to the previous program, MasterFolderMaker, which was used to experience the different possibilities of the Directory class.
